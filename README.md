# MockupFX

MockupFX is a GUI editor designed to make your life easier. It started 
as a project called mockup++ at the Hochschule Hannover, but was 
discontinued. It is still in early development and nearly unusable.  

Since it has the potential to become a great editor development 
continues here under the name MockupFX.
